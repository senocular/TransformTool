TransformTool
=============

JavaScript-based Free Transform Tool for manipulating objects in 2D space.

This probably isn't ready for production work, but will get you most of the way there.  There are no dependencies, and I don't think the code would be too terribly complex to adapt.

There are two versions, one using canvas, and the other using SVG to transform DOM elements built off of the canvas implementation.
